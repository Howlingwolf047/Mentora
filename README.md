## Mentora

**Mentora** is a web-based educational platform designed to facilitate effective communication and mentorship between teachers and students. The primary goal of Mentora is to create an interactive environment where academic progress can be monitored, feedback can be shared easily, and students can take an active role in their learning journey.

### Overview

Mentora addresses the challenges faced in traditional education systems where student progress often goes unnoticed, and teacher-student interaction is limited to classroom hours. By offering a digital space for continuous engagement, Mentora ensures that students receive timely guidance and support, while teachers are equipped with tools to track and enhance student performance.

### Key Features

- **Progress Tracking:** Teachers can view detailed academic performance and track improvements or areas needing attention for each student.
- **Feedback System:** Teachers can provide personalized feedback to students based on their performance, submitted work, or participation.
- **Doubt Resolution:** Students can raise questions or doubts, which teachers can address within the platform, promoting clarity and understanding.
- **Note Taking:** Students can write, organize, and manage their study notes within the system for easy reference and study.
- **Student Dashboard:** A personalized space for each student to monitor feedback, track goals, and stay updated on academic tasks.

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or frameworks like React or Vue.js)
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js (or Django / Flask if using Python)
